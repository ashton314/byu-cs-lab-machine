#+TITLE: BYU CS Lab Machine

A Docker image for the BYU lab machines.

** Motivation

I work primarily on macOS, but all of the CS department requires that your code run on an Ubuntu machine. This Docker image lets me have a Ubuntu machine to compile my code on, whilst editing it on macOS. Everyone wins.
